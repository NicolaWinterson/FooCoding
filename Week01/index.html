      <p> Reed is one of the UK's largest recruitment agencies. Following the end of an internship programme, I was taken on a permanent contract by Reed as a Resourcer, primarily to assist the team of consultants. I consider it an achievement that I was

        compliance and screening (police checks and right-to-work checks) and sourcing (contacting and searching for new job candidates) and all other associated administration for the recruitment consultants. My other responsibilities included:
        <ul class="list-experience">
          <li>Ensuring a constant ‘flow’ of candidates through headhunting, networking and researching the internal database and advertising/marketing response.</li>
          <li>Liaising with clients and candidates regarding payroll enquiries, and ensuring each week that all temporary employee timesheets were submitted and authorised before each payroll run.</li>
          <li>Sourcing for candidates, researching and self-determining search parameters in order to find the best fit for any given role.</li>
          <li>Writing and posting job adverts, utilising multiple methodologies to increase candidate attraction rates.</li>
          <li>Administering temporary employee expenses claim forms, as well as checking for and submitting holiday pay claims.</li>
